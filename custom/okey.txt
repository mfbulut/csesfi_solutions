### 101 Okey Maximum Score

You are given $n$ tiles, each defined by a color and a number.

You can form groups of tiles. Each tile may belong to at most one group. There are two types of valid groups:

- **Set:** 3 or 4 tiles with the **same number** but **different colors**.
- **Run:** 3 or more tiles with the **same color** and **consecutive numbers**.

The score is the sum of the numbers on all the tiles used in groups.
Your task is to compute the maximum achievable score.

**Input**
- The first input line contains an integer $n$: the number of tiles.
- The following $n$ lines describe the tiles. Each line contains two integers $c$ and $x$: the color and the number of the tile.

**Output**
- Print one integer: the maximum achievable score.
